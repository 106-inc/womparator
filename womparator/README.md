## Backend Setup (Python Flask)
Create a new Python project and install the necessary dependencies: Flask and Flask-CORS.

```bash
pip install flask flask_cors
```

Run the Flask server by executing the app.py file.

```bash
python app.py
```
The Flask server will start and listen on http://localhost:8080.

## Frontend Setup (React)
Create a new React application using Create React App or your preferred method.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Run the React application by executing the following command inside the project folder:

```bash
npm start
```

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the greeting message from the Flask backend displayed on the page.
